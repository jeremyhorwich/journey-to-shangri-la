Journey to Shangri-La - Jeremy Horwich
October-November 2020

A basic navigational puzzle game written in C# in Unity Game Engine. The game can be downloaded and played here: https://hicorysauce.itch.io/journey-to-shangri-la.
All assets beyond the game engine itself used in the final project were created by me. Programming files can be found in Assets/Scripts/.

Known issues:
- Standing on a ladder after using it will cause the player to keep shifting between the ladder's top and bottom and can cause camera issues
